### Notes About Software Development:

Start by brainstorming ideas with your team. Use whiteboards to discuss concepts and organize tasks on a Kanban board if helpful.

Next, use an LLM (Claude works particularly well for coding) to help bring those ideas to life and truly experience them.

### Night At The Museum

Night At The Museum is an event that showcases the talent of CS students. Walking through the event, it was impressive to see how many students were genuinely invested in computer science and producing high-quality work.

There were standout projects across multiple levels — a CSP game teaching concepts about crypto mining, and a CSP/CSA project using a Gemini backend that could process both text and images, including one that analyzed news sources and identified their political leanings.

The AI thesis generator was particularly impressive, producing a full, well-structured paragraph from just a few input words — the kind of output that could hold up on an AP exam.

The games were equally impressive, with one asteroid-style game that looked like a polished commercial product. Overall, N@TM served as a reminder of just how much is possible in CS with dedication and creativity.

When our group presented our game was unfortunately in an unplayable state which caused us to have nothing to present.
